The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there might be unexpected behavior when combining `calc()` with other CSS properties or units. For instance, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not work as expected if the parent element's width is not explicitly defined.  Another issue arises with spaces in `calc()` expressions. Incorrect spacing, especially around operators, can lead to calculation errors.
